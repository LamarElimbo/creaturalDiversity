#### Purpose of project:
  For this project I wanted to figure out how creatural diversity in supernatural dramas affected IMDB ratings.  Being that shows like 'Supernatural' and 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' consist of several seasons, I hypothesized that higher creatural diversity would correlate with higher IMDB ratings.

#### How data was collected:
* For this project I programmed six separate web scrapers, in order to collect a list of the different creatures that were featured in high creaturally diverse shows.
* I imported bs4-BeautifulSoup, urllib-request and pandas in order to collect the relevant information and create the dataframes.
* Where data was collected from:
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buffyverse_villains_and_supernatural_beings 
    * __Description__: A list of creatures featured in Buffy the Vampire Slayer
  * http://charmed.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Magical_beings

#### Analysis:
* I used the pandas library, to aid in a preliminary analysis of the data, alongside bokeh in order to create some rudimentary visualizations.  The majority of the data analysis took place in excel.

#### Visualizations:
* I created a total of 18 visualizations 
* All of the bar graph visualizations were made with powerpoint

#### Journal Entries:
* I had the chance to create six web scrapers for this project.
* This project allowed me to really explore excel's data analysis capabilities for the first time. Until now I have felt as though people in the data science community looked down on excel, however now that I have really experimented with it, I'm definitely going to make it one of my go-to tools.
* I also had the chance to reconnect with some aspects of web design (html, css) which I haven't had the chance to do in while and also play with some new tools for the first time (jquery, d3.js).
