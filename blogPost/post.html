            <h1>A Creatural Mosaic Ranked for Success</h1>
            <p>Fangs out, claws protracted and transformations complete.  It's vampire versus werewolf and no one seems to know for sure who is going to come out the victor.

It's an age-old question,  which to some may even be considered a clich√©d concept, overly explored in shows and movies.  And while many have fallen victim to this infernal debate, I decided to look into which of these two creatures is favoured more by the public.  Then I asked myself, 'why limit your inquiry to only vampires and werewolves?'  Which is when I decided to broaden my scope and figure out how other supernatural beings compare against each other in terms of public opinion.

            <h1>The Influence of Creatural Diversity on Supernatural Success</h1>
            <p>I decided to start this project by  first defining some of the key concepts that I wante to explore.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Supernatural drama: </em></strong>Including any non-comedic fictional, supernatural show</p>
            <p><strong><em>Creatural diversity: </em>T</strong>he number of different types of supernatural creatures featured on the show</p>
            <p><strong><em>High creatural diversity: </em></strong>Many types of creatures of different abilities</p>
            <p><strong><em>Medium creatural diversity:  </em></strong>1-5 types of creatures of different abilities</p>
            <p><strong><em>Low creatural diversity: </em></strong>1-3 types of creatures of relatively equal ability</p>
            <p><strong><em>Success: </em></strong>Ratings on popular websites (e.g., IMDB), number of episodes, number of seasons, number of years running</p>
            <p>After having defined the three different levels of creatural diversity I selected a total of 36 shows and 15 movies that would be divided equally among the three levels, such that each level had 12 shows and 5 movies.  </p>
            
            <h4>High Creatural Diversity (Level 1)</h4>
            <p><em><strong>Shows: </strong></em>Angel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed, Dark Shadows, Lost Girl, Merlin, Once Upon a Time, Penny Dreadful, Salem, Sanctuary, Shadowhunters, Supernatural</p>
            <p><em><strong>Movies: </strong></em>Ella Enchanted, Halloweentown, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey</p>
            
            <h4>Medium Creatural Diversity (Level 2)</h4>
            <p><em><strong>Shows: </strong></em>Being Human UK, Dr Who, Grimm, Hemlock Grove, Hercules, Star Trek Voyager, The Originals, Vampire Diaries, Torchwood, True Blood, Witches of East End, Xena</p>
            <p><em><strong>Movies: </strong></em>Beetlejuice, Enchanted, Hocus Pocus, Pirates of the Carribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl, Twilight</p>
            
            <h4>Low Creatural Diversity (Level 3)</h4>
            <p><em><strong>Shows: </strong></em>Bitten, Dead Like Me, Ghost Whisperer, Humans, iZombie, Medium, Moonlight, Roswell, Teen Wolf, The Secret Circle, The Walking Dead, V</p>
            <p><em><strong>Movies: </strong></em>ET, Fright Night, Ghost, Interview with the Vampire, The Lost Boys</p>
            
            <p>The following graph depicts the relative imdb ratings of the shows and movies of each category, also taking into account the number of ratings for each.</p>

            <div class='square'><img src="../visualizations/images/graphs/mockup/diversityGraph.jpg"></div>
            
            <p>While there does not seem to be much distinction between diversity levels one and two, diversity level three shows an interesting trend between the two groups.  It seems that, of the shows collected, shows with low creatural diversity are actually more favoured by the public vote, as oppose to the disadvantage of low creatural diversity seen in the movies collected.</p>

            <h1>The Influence of Individual Creatures on Supernatural Success</h1>
            <p>The following badges illustrate which supernatural beings appeared to be the most favoured among the 51 titles collected.</p>
            <p>You can click on the individual badges to reveal further information on how shows and movies with that specific creature were rated, on average, compared to shows and movies without it.  Even though Each of the numbered values are out of 100, some of the values may appear smaller than expected because the number of people who rated were taken into consideration (see github link for more details).</p>
